## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

* `📄 index.html`: This file contains the basic HTML structure of the calculator, including the display screen and all the buttons.
* `🎨 style.css`: This file styles the entire application. It uses CSS Grid for the button layout and media queries to ensure the design is fully responsive.
* `🧠 main.js`: This is the brain of the calculator. It contains all the JavaScript code to capture user input, handle button clicks, and perform the mathematical calculations.
